		<h1>GAME PROGRAMMING WITH C#</h1>
		<p>
			Recently, I am learning C# language. I am currently enrolling for 
			<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/gameprogramming">Beginning Game
			Programming with C#</a> offered by Coursera. This course is all about learning 
			how to develop video games using the C# programming language. Why use C# instead of C++, Java, 
			ActionScript, or some other programming language you may have heard of? First, using C# lets us 
			use the Microsoft XNA and open-source MonoGame frameworks, which help us quickly develop games 
			for Windows, Android, iOS, Mac OS, and others. Second, the Unity game engine is very popular with 
			indie game developers, and C# is one of the programming languages you can use in the Unity environment. 
			<br><br>
			This course is 12 weeks long, and each week there is a programming assignment that must be completed.
			There are also several project increments that need to be completed. The project increment is to build
			a full shooting game functionality that is controlled using Xbox 360 controller or mouse. 
			In this blog, you can find the video about the game. I will try to upload the video every week. 
		</p>
		
		<h2>Programming Assignment 2 </h2>
		<p>The big idea behind this assignment is to write a program that displays a random 
			sprite with a random x and y speed that starts in the center of the window. 
			Approximately each second, a new random sprite with a random x and y speed that 
			starts in the center of the window (the old sprite will go away) will be generated.</p>

		<h3>Programming Assignment 3</h3>
		<p>
			Start with a rock, centered in the window, with a random sprite and a random diagonal velocity. 
			The rock should immediately start moving. Every second, if there are fewer than 3 rocks in the window, 
			spawn a new rock, centered in the window, with a random sprite and a random diagonal velocity. 
			The rock should immediately start moving. Every update, for each rock that's outside the window, 
			spawn a new rock, centered in the window, with a random sprite and a random diagonal velocity. 
			The rock should immediately start moving

		<h3>Programming Assignment 4</h3>
		<p>
			In this program, a Teddy object will appear in the center on window, not moving.
			On every right mouse click, a Pickup object will appear where the mouse click.
			When the player left click the Teddy object, the teddy starts collecting the pickups
			in which they were placed. The Teddy bear will stop moving at the last position of the 
			pickups object. If the player adds more pickups while the Teddy is moving, the Teddy picks
			them up as well. If the player adds more Pickups while the Teddy is stopped, the player
			has to left click on the Teddy again to start it collecting again.
