			GAME DESIGN WITH PYTHON 
		</h1>
		
		<p>I am currently taking a Python class at Coursera.org. This course is really interesting.
				This class teaches about some object oriented concepts (OOP). Each week, there is a 
				programming assignment that each student must complete. This class has a new browser-based 
				programming environment that makes developing interactive applications in Python simple. 
				These applications will involve windows whose contents are graphical and respond to buttons, 
				the keyboard and the mouse. So, I made a small blog to share my idea and my progress. Happy learning!

		<h2>Game 1-Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock</h2>
		<a id="py1" href="http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user39_6goTD5CxFD_1.py" targer="_blank">RPSLS</a>
		<p id="game1">Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock (RPSLS) is a variant of Rock-paper-scissors that 
			allows five choices. Each choice wins against two other choices, loses against two other choices 
			and ties against itself. </p>
		
		<br>
		
		<h2>Game 2-Guess the Number</h2>
		<a id="py2" href="http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user39_pVZZNnojRt_1.py" target="_blank">Guess the Number</a>
		<p id="game2">One of the simplest two-player games is “Guess the number”. The first player thinks 
			of a secret number in some known range while the second player attempts to guess the number. 
			After each guess, the first player answers either “Higher”, “Lower” or “Correct!” depending 
			on whether the secret number is higher, lower or equal to the guess. </p>
		<br>
		
		<h2>Game 3-Stopwatch: The Game</h2>
		<a id="py3" href="http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user39_PXrm8mvpnW_2.py">Stopwatch: The Game</a>
		<p id="game3">This project focuses on combining text drawing in the canvas with timers to build a simple 
			digital stopwatch that keeps track of the time in tenths of a second. The stopwatch 
			contains "Start", "Stop" and "Reset" buttons. This project can turn your stopwatch into a test of reflexes, 
			add to two numerical counters that keep track of the number of times that you have stopped the watch 
			and how many times you manage to stop the watch on a whole second (1.0, 2.0, 3.0, etc.).</p>
		<br>
		
		<h2>Game 4-Pong Game</h2>
		<a id="py4" href="http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user39_LzRdHyFYmF_1.py">Pong</a>
		<p id="game4">In this project, we will build a version of Pong, one of the first arcade video games (1972). 
			While Pong is not particularly exciting compared to today's video games, Pong is relatively simple 
			to build and provides a nice opportunity to work on the skills that you will need to build a game 
			in the later projects like Asteroids.</p>
